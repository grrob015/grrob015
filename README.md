# Hey, I'm Gabe, an [IT student](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-roberts-b43921344/) üêß ü™ü

<h2>About Me:</h2>

Hi! My name is Gabe, I'm 22 years old, and I am looking to start my career in IT, stemmed from an interest in PC gaming and programming. I am doing self-directed studies in helpdesk IT, programming, and Linux, currently using a dualboot computer with Arch Linux and Windows 10. Outside of tech I enjoy reading books on philosophy, psychology, and self-improvement (and Batman ü¶á). My projects and portfolio are down below, please enjoy your stay!
